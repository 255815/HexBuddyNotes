# ðŸ˜ƒ Wanna Be a Hacker ?

## What is a Hacker ?

No am not going to use Google, In Simple Words a Hacker is a Person who Tries To Gain access to a System Or Network in an Unusual way ( Ethical Hacker )

Hacking is a creative sport and it's a collaborative sport people team up and you can team up over the Internet and having the best hackers out there give their best for a couple of weeks and then you get this creative outburst that you will never have seen before, also, on a technological level, you get the opportunity to see infrastructure that you've never seen before or new technologies that you have never seen before, it's really awesome to see everybody working and making the Internet safer, that is the true power of a Hacker

> _A lot of people think of hackers as geeky computer nerds who live in their parent's basement, and spread computer viruses. But, I don't see it that way. Hackers are innovators. Hackers are people who challenge and change the systems to make them work differently, to make them work better. It's just how they think, it's a mindset. I'm growing up in a world that needs more people with the hacker mindset, and not just for technology. Everything is up for being hacked, even skiing, even education. So whether it's Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg or Shane McConkey, having the hacker mindset can change the world. Healthy, happy, creativity, and the hacker mindset are all a large part of my education_
