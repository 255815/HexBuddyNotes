Legion is an OSINT tool used for mapping and information gathering and this is the best tool for beginners to do network mapping.

1. Automatic recon and scanning with NMAP, Shodan, whataweb, nikto, Vulners, Hydra, SMBenum, dirbuster, sslyzer, webslayer. Got a lot of tools twisted ito the tool‚Ä¶
2. GUI (grahical user interface) Very easy to use this tool.
3. Easily customizable and can load own scripts against target.
