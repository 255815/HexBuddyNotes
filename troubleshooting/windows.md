# Windows



## Disk Management

so few hours ago i faced a problems which i shirked a 39 GB From The Disk But I Was Not Able To Extend The Disk Again

So what I Did is The Following

1. Run CMD As Admin
2. Run This Command : diskpart
3. Run This Command : list disk
4. then you will choose the disk number you are targeting&#x20;
5. Run This Command : select disk \<disk #> ( Usually 0 )
6. Run : list partition
7. select partition < number of the partition you wanna delete >
8. delete partition override

Done ! ..... I Hope this was useful&#x20;
